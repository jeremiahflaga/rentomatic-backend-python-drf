# [Rentomatic of Leonardo Giordani](http://blog.thedigitalcatonline.com/blog/2016/11/14/clean-architectures-in-python-a-step-by-step-example/) using the Django REST Framework (DRF) 

This is my attempt of doing the sample project in ["Clean architectures in Python: a step-by-step example"](http://blog.thedigitalcatonline.com/blog/2016/11/14/clean-architectures-in-python-a-step-by-step-example/) of Leonardo Giordani using DRF instead of Flask.

My purpose for this is to practice the use of TDD and the Clean Architecture model of Uncle Bob Martin.
